# Memory-Frequency-Access-Analysis

Infrastructure : LLVM
Compiler : Clang
Language : C++
Source files : C

LLVM Pass for code optimization on Intermediate Representation (IR) generated by compiler. It takes into account the access frequency of particular memory locations based on "load" and "store" instructions present in the IR. It identifies and differentiate between the "load" and "store" for each function data pointers. Also, memory allocated through heap is identified through calls to malloc present in the IR.
